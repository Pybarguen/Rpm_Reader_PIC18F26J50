**PIC18F2xJ50** Needs a basic circuit connection for work, you can make a fast circuit on your protoboard using **28-pin SOIC DIP adapter** or you can make the PCB circuit :
**Make sure that you have read the PIC18F2xJ0 this device can be obtain in diferents packages 28-Pin SPDIP/SOIC/SSOP** get the correct adapter for you device

## **PIC18F26J50 Lite Develoment Board**

This is a basic PCB board for test faster your prototypes using PIC18F26J50 microcontroller, **you can use it on your protoboard** I'm working in a advance version you could see it in others repositories, you can find lite_version'files on this project.

**Updating More Information about this setion**

## **Encoder Sensor, DC Motor Bracket and Base**

this parts were built using **Blender** software and **CAD Sketcher Addon**, however you can use any CAD software for read de DXF,OBJ,STL,FBX files.
I used a Laser Machine for cut the parts on MDF 2.5mm WOOD, you can see the parts of the model here and the physical model. **If you can't make this part, you can also use a gear motor and simple basic encoder sensor**

## **How to Run**
 If you want to run the code on the microcontroller quickly Download **.Hex** and upload the Program on the microcontroller Using **Pickit Software**, you need to Know the **PIC18F26J50** needs a basic circuit for work, the basic circuit is on the PIC18F26J50 Lite Develoment Board uploaded on this project, if you want some information about this click on this page:

You can check the circuit using each module for example connect first the **PIC18F26J50** with the **ST7735 TFT Display** and test how to work, then make the same add other module for example **F249 Speed sensor module**

**Connect the circuit using the electronic technical planes on your protoboard**
